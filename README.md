## To do

- Expand API documentation.

## SemVer

We follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). But it still before `1.0.0`, and for now version number follows this rules:

* If major breaking changes introduced, then MINOR (middle) number is incremented
* If there are no breaking changes, or only minor, which probably won't affect anybody, then PATCH (last) number is incremented
